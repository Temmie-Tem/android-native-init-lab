# A90 Campaign Ledger

Append-only. One line per experiment action or material health/recovery state
transition under the Interim Fast-Loop Rules in `AGENTS.md`. This replaces
per-run prose reports for routine work only. It does not replace the private
structured result, append-only journal, raw logs, or transfer accounting
required by the selected tier and target contract.

For trial retirement, count only the first `CAMPAIGN_CLOSED` action row for
each distinct campaign ID across both ledgers. Duplicate close, parked, and
per-action health rows do not count.

Write a separate report only for a new capability, a new hazard class, an
incident, or a genuinely ambiguous device-safety result.

Metrics:

- information-bearing results per week: `PROVED + REFUTED`;
- information yield: `(PROVED + REFUTED) / all device attempts`; and
- observer no-proof rate: `NO_PROOF_OBSERVER / all device attempts`.

Device safety is recorded independently from experiment proof. A timeout or
late endpoint may be `HEALTH_PENDING`, `HOST_OBSERVER_FAILURE`, or
`RECOVERY_PENDING_PARKED` without closing the campaign.

## Format

`<UTC> | <campaign> | <ordinal> | <tier> | <action> | <HEALTHY|HEALTH_PENDING|HOST_OBSERVER_FAILURE|RECOVERY_PENDING_PARKED|RECOVERY_REQUIRED> | <PROVED|REFUTED|NO_PROOF_OBSERVER|N/A> | <candidate-transfers>/<rollback-transfers> | <one-line finding>`
