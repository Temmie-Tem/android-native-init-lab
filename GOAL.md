# Goal: S22+ repeatable native PID 1

Build a repeatable path from the FYG8 Android vendor boot chain and
source-matched kernel to a custom static `/init` running as PID 1, then grow
that entry point into a minimal observable and recoverable runtime.

This goal reports state, never device authority. The binding layers are
`AGENTS.md`, `docs/operations/targets/S22PLUS_FYG8_TARGET_CONTRACT.md`, and
`docs/operations/DEVICE_ACTION_PROCESS_V2.md`. Select only
`SM-S906N/g0q/S906NKSS7FYG8`; A90 and S20+ remain isolated.

## Current bounded unit

Changed-path regression reference: [past failure checklist](docs/operations/S22PLUS_FYG8_PAST_FAILURE_CHECKLIST.md).

Prepare one reviewed attended batch of three fixed display-step candidates:
P372 queues one fixed pattern; P373 queues two fixed patterns in order; P374
exits its display child after a fixed request starts, before completion. Shared
PID1 supervision must retain CONTROL independently of child work. Queued,
started, completed, child-failed, Download arrival, rollback and final health
remain separate evidence. Pixel output remains operator observation unless
independently proved.

Implementation, strict ARM64 A/B builds, candidate-static/common checks and one
shared independent review are complete. All three READY manifests and the
source-bound attended-session capability review are published; 142 changed-path
tests plus two activation-gate tests passed. See the [shared H0 report](docs/reports/S22PLUS_FYG8_DISPLAY_STEP_SESSION_H0_2026-09-09.md).

Fresh P372 fixed D0 preparation passed and reopened in
`p372-ready1-prepared-20260909-1`. No session grant, reboot or candidate transfer
has occurred. Current operator attendance is pending. The bound session permits
three reservations/two hours, with fresh connected preparation/binding per run;
only PASS advances the ordered catalog. Unproved recovery or unexplained device
interruption closes the grant to new experiments while preserving already
authorized journal-bound recovery. P373/P374 preparation follows prior healthy
closure; no consumed candidate or prepared run is replayed.

P371's separately approved third preparation is consumed and CLOSED/19 with
`PASS_F1_V2_P371_NATIVE_RETURN_CONTROL_AND_ROLLED_BACK`, recovery_required=false.
Two fixed STATUS replies after planned handoff passed, with signed native
spacing 2121 ms and the expected unreaped-child/wait facts. CONTROL, exact
Download, one candidate/rollback and final rooted FYG8/original hashes/Android
health passed. No native session or replay authority remains. Earlier ABORTED/4
and cold-ADB preparation records are preserved; no continuous-liveness/pixel/
kernel-stall or unattended claim follows. See the [P371 report](docs/reports/S22PLUS_FYG8_P371_FIXED_STATUS_PREPARATION_2026-09-09.md).


## Archive and continuing boundaries

The previous 799-line goal, including P371 closure and earlier archive links,
is preserved byte-for-byte in [the completed-history archive](docs/archive/roadmaps/GOAL_THROUGH_P371_2026-09-09.md).
That history is evidence only. Private append-only campaign records and run
journals remain authoritative for effects. Consumed candidates are never replayed.

Never prepare a new experiment over unhealthy or uncertain state. Preserve exact
target, current boot, candidate/rollback, topology, source and journal bindings.
An unexplained device-session failure stops the experiment; retain raw evidence
and continue only allowed observation and preauthorized recovery. A reporting
failure never repeats a device effect. A90 and S20+ are outside this unit.
